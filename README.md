Personal projects

CV is a folder where i made my cv as a web page with HTML and CSS.

Banners.Zip is a folder where i put my designs made as a Graphic Design intern at a marketing company.

In the Figma links you can find my designs in Figma one done and one is for a scheduling app, and the other, still in progress, is a landing page for a university project on Custom Cars, which will later be implemented as a web page.

Flatty Bong 2.0 is a game—a simplified version of Flappy Bird—created in Unity with C#. The design was made in Procreate on my tablet and then used in the game. You can find the rest of the files in my other repository called Flatty-Bong.
